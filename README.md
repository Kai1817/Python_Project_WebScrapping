# Python_WebScrapping

Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user.
Be it a spreadsheet or an API.

The file  'webscraping_tips.py'  contains the valuable information about the python libraries that are used for web scraping.
Using those libraries i have shown how to extract datas from a particular website.
Those datas may be present in the form of text,paragraph,title,url images and many other.

The next file  'flipkart_scrap_starting.py'  is a good example of scraping where we are scraping datas from the flipkart website.
i have selected mobile phones of samsung that are above thirty thousand.This consist of total 23 pages.
The process and codes are well explained in the file.Read the multiline and single line comments in the codes to get a better idea of what the actual process is.
This will give a pure idea of web scraping.

Coming onto the file  'scraping_more_flipkart.py' contains a better view of web scraping.We consider the same website flipkart.
The changes done in the codes here are,we have introduced a user input where we type any electornics product name that is available on flipkart and we will get the 
desired results in the form of sorted dataframe.The dataframe will consit all the products related to the search as an user input.
Later if we want to save the data frame in the form of a csv file then its also can be done easily and the process is mentioned in the code.

The file  "utility_tool_webscraping_flipkart.py"  is an automated tool that i have desined,taking into consideration the need of webscraping.
What this tool basicaly does is,if we take user input as any product name lets say 'shoes' or 't-shirts men' or any product available in flipkart,
the tool will for sure scrap the datas of all necessary things related to the product.The necessary things like product name,price,description and Reviews.

suppose there is missing reviews or description related to any product then the missing spaces will be automatically filled with 'Not available'.

Note: web scraping can't be done from every website. There are privacy rules for some website such that we cant access it for webscraping.
